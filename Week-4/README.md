## Week 4 Summary — Tree-Based Ensembles

This week focused on advanced tree-based machine learning methods and
practical model evaluation.

Topics covered:

- Decision Trees and their limitations  
- Random Forests and variance reduction  
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV  
- Model interpretability using permutation importance  
- Gradient Boosting and boosting philosophy  
- Practical tuning of boosting models  
- Complete ensemble comparison project

By the end of Week 4, a full understanding was developed of how to:
- Train and tune ensemble models  
- Compare models fairly  
- Interpret model predictions  
- Select a final model using sound reasoning
