### Day 2 — Random Forests: Ensemble Learning & Stability

**Goal:**  
Understand how ensemble learning using Random Forest reduces overfitting and
improves model stability compared to a single Decision Tree.

**What was done:**
- Trained and compared a Decision Tree and a Random Forest model
- Observed overfitting behavior in single trees
- Studied how Random Forest improves generalization
- Compared feature importance from Tree vs Forest
- Analyzed effect of number of trees on performance
- Validated stability using cross-validation

**Key Learning:**  
Averaging predictions from many randomized trees significantly reduces variance,
making Random Forest a strong and reliable baseline model for structured data.
