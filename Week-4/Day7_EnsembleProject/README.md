### Day 7 — Ensemble Comparison Mini Project

**Goal:**  
Combine all Week 4 concepts into a complete evaluation pipeline and select the
best model using data-driven reasoning.

**What was done:**
- Trained Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models
- Compared models using 5-fold cross-validation
- Evaluated final performance on the test set
- Selected the best model based on accuracy and stability
- Analyzed feature importance for interpretability

**Final Decision:**  
Random Forest was chosen as the final model because it provided the best
combination of high test accuracy, stability, and interpretability.

**Key Learning:**  
Model selection should consider cross-validation performance, test accuracy,
variance, and explainability rather than relying on a single metric.
