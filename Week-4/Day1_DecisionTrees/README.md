### Day 1 — Decision Tree Fundamentals

**Goal:**  
Understand Decision Trees as non-linear models and study how tree depth
controls model complexity and overfitting.

**What was done:**
- Loaded Breast Cancer dataset and created train/test split
- Trained Decision Trees with different maximum depths
- Compared training and test accuracy to observe overfitting behavior
- Visualized decision tree structure and splits
- Extracted and plotted feature importance

**Key Learning:**  
Decision Trees can model complex feature interactions but easily overfit.
Controlling depth is essential, and ensemble methods are needed for stability.
