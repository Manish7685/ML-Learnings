### Day 3 — Random Forest Hyperparameter Tuning

**Goal:**  
Improve Random Forest performance by tuning key hyperparameters and controlling
the bias–variance trade-off using cross-validation.

**What was done:**
- Trained default Random Forest as baseline
- Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV
- Compared tuned and default model performance
- Analyzed effect of depth, splits, and feature randomness
- Interpreted tuning results to understand model behavior

**Key Learning:**  
Structured hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation helps improve
generalization and provides insight into how model complexity affects
performance.
