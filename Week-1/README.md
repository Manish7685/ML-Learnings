# 📅 **Day-by-Day Summary**

---

## **📘 Day 1 — Numpy Basics**
- Learned array creation, indexing, slicing  
- Performed vectorized operations  
- Implemented basic matrix operations  
- Understood the importance of Numpy for ML pipelines  

---

## **📗 Day 2 — Pandas Basics**
- Loaded CSV files  
- Explored DataFrames  
- Cleaned missing data  
- Manipulated columns and rows  
- Practiced grouping, merging, and filtering  

---

## **📙 Day 3 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Loaded raw Titanic dataset  
- Inspected missing values  
- Explored distributions (Age, Fare, Pclass, Sex)  
- Visualized relationships with Seaborn & Matplotlib  
- Identified key patterns (e.g., Women and 1st class survive more)  

---

## **📕 Day 4 — Feature Engineering**
Created high-quality ML features:
- Encoded Sex / Embarked  
- Binned Age (AgeGroup)  
- Handled missing values  
- Dropped irrelevant columns (Name, Ticket, Cabin)  
- Exported final cleaned dataset:  titanic_processed.csv

---

## **🧮 Day 5 — Logistic Regression Model**
- Split dataset into train/test  
- Trained Logistic Regression  
- Evaluated model using:  
- Accuracy  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Precision/Recall/F1  
- ROC Curve & AUC  
- Identified key coefficients  
- Saved notebook results  

---

## **🌲 Day 6 — Tree Models (Decision Tree & Random Forest)**
- Trained a Decision Tree with max_depth tuning  
- Trained a Random Forest as a stronger baseline  
- Visualized feature importances  
- Compared both with Logistic Regression  
- Observed improved performance with Random Forest  

---

## **🔧 Day 7 — Hyperparameter Tuning**
Optimized Random Forest using:
- **RandomizedSearchCV**
- 5-fold cross-validation  
- Search space for:
- n_estimators  
- max_depth  
- min_samples_split  
- min_samples_leaf  
- max_features  

After tuning:
- Accuracy improved  
- AUC improved  
- ROC curve showed stronger separation  
- Saved final model as: best_model/tuned_random_forest.pkl
