# Week 2 Day 4 — Regularization & Overfitting

This day focuses on understanding overfitting and how regularization
improves model generalization in Logistic Regression.

## Topics Covered
- Underfitting vs Overfitting
- Bias–Variance Tradeoff
- L2 Regularization
- Effect of regularization strength (C)
- Model selection using train/test performance

## Key Insight
Regularization controls model complexity.
The best model is not the one with highest training accuracy,
but the one that generalizes well to unseen data.
