# 📘 Week 2 — Supervised Learning & Model Evaluation

This week focused on strengthening the **core supervised machine learning foundations**  
with a strong emphasis on **correct evaluation techniques and model improvement strategies**.

We moved beyond just training models and learned how to:
- Evaluate models properly  
- Control overfitting  
- Interpret model behavior  
- Improve performance using features  
- Select models using cross-validation  

The goal of Week 2 was to build **industry-standard ML evaluation and selection skills**.
