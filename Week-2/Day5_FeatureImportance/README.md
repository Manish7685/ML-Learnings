# Week 2 Day 5 — Feature Importance & Model Interpretability

This day focuses on understanding **why a Logistic Regression model
makes its predictions** using interpretable techniques.

## Topics Covered
- Model interpretability and its importance
- Logistic Regression coefficients
- Importance of feature standardization
- Feature importance using coefficient magnitude
- Odds ratios for quantitative interpretation
- Permutation feature importance
- Global vs local interpretability
- Limitations of feature importance methods

## Key Takeaways
- Coefficients indicate direction and strength of influence
- Odds ratios provide intuitive explanations
- Permutation importance measures real performance impact
- Feature importance reflects model behavior, not causation
- Interpretability must be combined with domain knowledge
