# Week 2 Day 2 — Logistic Regression (From Scratch + Sklearn)

This day covers the full implementation of **Logistic Regression**, following Andrew Ng’s notation, and applies it to the Breast Cancer dataset.

## 🔹 Topics Covered
- Sigmoid function
- Logistic regression model:  
  \[
  f_{w,b}(x) = \sigma(w \cdot x + b)
  \]
- Loss and Cost functions
- Gradient computation (dJ/dw, dJ/db)
- Full Gradient Descent loop
- Train/Test split + Feature Scaling
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1
- Comparison with sklearn's LogisticRegression

## 🔹 Results
Both models perform with **~94–97% accuracy**, confirming correct implementation.
