# Week 2 Day 3 — Logistic Regression Evaluation

This day focuses on evaluating Logistic Regression models trained on the
Breast Cancer dataset.

## Topics Covered
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1
- Threshold tuning
- ROC Curve & AUC
- Precision–Recall Curve
- Confusion Matrix analysis
- Comparison of Sklearn vs Gradient Descent implementation

## Key Insight
Model performance depends strongly on the chosen threshold.
ROC and PR curves provide threshold-independent evaluation.
