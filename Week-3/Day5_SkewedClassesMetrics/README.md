### Day 5 — Skewed Classes & Evaluation Metrics

**Goal:**  
Understand why accuracy is misleading on imbalanced datasets and learn to
evaluate models using precision, recall, and F1-score.

**What was done:**
- Created an imbalanced classification dataset
- Trained Logistic Regression and evaluated using accuracy
- Computed precision, recall, and F1-score
- Compared with dummy baseline that predicts majority class
- Compared all metrics side-by-side to guide evaluation

**Key Learning:**  
On imbalanced datasets, recall and F1-score are often more meaningful than
accuracy, and evaluation metrics must align with real-world objectives.
