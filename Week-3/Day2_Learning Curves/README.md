### Day 2 — Learning Curves & Bias–Variance Diagnosis

**Goal:**  
Learn how to diagnose model performance problems and decide whether to add
more data, change model complexity, or engineer better features.

**What was done:**
- Built Logistic Regression pipelines with different regularization strengths
- Computed learning curves using cross-validation
- Plotted training vs validation accuracy for increasing data sizes
- Diagnosed underfitting and overfitting patterns
- Confirmed conclusions using final test set evaluation

**Key Learning:**  
Learning curves are powerful diagnostic tools that help determine whether
model improvements should focus on data, features, or model complexity.
