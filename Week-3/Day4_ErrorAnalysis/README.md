### Day 4 — Error Analysis on Classification Models

**Goal:**  
Understand where and why a model makes mistakes by analyzing misclassified
samples instead of relying only on overall accuracy.

**What was done:**
- Trained Logistic Regression using a proper pipeline
- Generated predictions on unseen test data
- Built confusion matrix to identify error types
- Isolated false positives and false negatives
- Compared feature patterns of correct and incorrect predictions
- Analyzed probability confidence of misclassified samples

**Key Learning:**  
Error analysis reveals overlapping class regions and guides whether to
improve features, collect more data, or switch to more expressive models.
