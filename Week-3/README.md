## ✅ Week 3 Summary — Model Evaluation & Selection

Week 3 focused on learning how to evaluate, compare, and improve models using
systematic and data-driven techniques rather than intuition or trial-and-error.

### Skills Gained
- Hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation
- Bias–variance diagnosis using learning curves
- Fair model comparison using CV statistics
- Error analysis on misclassified samples
- Evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score
- ROC and Precision–Recall curve analysis
- Threshold tuning based on application goals

### Outcome
By the end of Week 3, a complete and professional model evaluation workflow was
implemented, enabling informed model selection and performance improvement for
real-world classification problems.
