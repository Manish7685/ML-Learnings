### Day 7 — Mini Evaluation Project (Full Workflow)

**Goal:**  
Apply the complete model evaluation workflow learned in Week 3 on a medical
classification problem and select a final model using data-driven reasoning.

**What was done:**
- Trained baseline models (Logistic Regression and Decision Tree)
- Compared models using cross-validation (mean and standard deviation)
- Analyzed bias–variance using learning curves
- Performed error analysis with confusion matrix and FP/FN counts
- Evaluated performance using precision, recall, and F1-score
- Plotted ROC and Precision–Recall curves
- Tuned decision threshold to improve recall for medical screening

**Key Learning:**  
Professional model selection requires combining cross-validation, diagnostics,
error analysis, and threshold tuning instead of relying on a single metric.
